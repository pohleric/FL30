# FL30 processing scripts

This is a suite of R scripts to process discharge measurements from an Albillia FL30 fluorometer.
In the folder doc/ you find an English and a Russian manual with step-by-step explanation.

For the processing you need RStudio because the scripts use the interactive `click()` function.
You can run the scripts according to their numbering. The scripts use a rather old "XLSX" package to read Excel files. This requires JAVA. Future versions might replace the library to avoid the depdency on Java.

You need to adjust the `path` in the scripts according to you computer paths.
